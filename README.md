# chaos-playground
I will be adding a Dormand Prince numerical integrator and a little framework for playing around with chaos using differential equations. Also working on code to calculate largest lyapunov exponent in order to detect chaos. Eventually going to shift to applying this to machine learning but want to get more practice first so am going to focus on making weird fractal music.
